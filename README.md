# Cloud-Projects--Azure
Back in february 2021, when I was i my 5th semester(B.Tech).
I did a Cloud computing course from Verzeo, during which I made 3 projects,amongst which 2 which are present here.
I'm not including project details(Goals and Expected outputs) here as it's already present in the files.
These projects are very detailed and well explained(Step by step explanation with pictures added too)
I mastered the basics of Cloud very well,even helped my teammates in doing the projects and solved their querries too.
Cloud is a great platform which is on a boom now-a-days,so decided to pursue it.
Invested my good time in making.
Hope you'll like it...
